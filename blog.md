# McPherson's Radical Ideology
 Tara McPherson argues within her essay titled ‘Why are the Digital Humanities so White?/ Thinking the Histories of Race and Computation’ that the study, practices and development of Digital Humanities (DH), is, in its core, an unintentionally racist field of study. She argues that due to the time frame and people working within DH during its origination (post-WWII computational culture) that the very programming and foundation of the study is grown from and engaged upon without consideration of race. I argue that everything McPherson displays and illustrates about DH being racist is not logical as she compares a system of coding and operating in a computer to that of the real world. Furthermore, McPherson stretches analogies and comparisons thin to form a confirmation-bias. From lenticular lenses to the UNIX operating system, McPherson’s essay takes unorganized turns to try to deceit the reader into agreeing with her.

First I’d like to outline the illogical ideas that McPherson presents, mainly focusing on her perspective of the lenticular lens. McPherson brings up the idea of a lenticular lense, the ones used for 3D postcards and bookmarks that a kid would enjoy. She compares it to the stereoscope, a similar 3D image illusion made during the industrial era and around the time of civil rights movement. She argues that since the stereoscope creates one whole image, and not multiple fragmented ones like the lenticular lens, that it reflects the cultures of their respective time frames. Industrial and civil rights; Whole. Digital computer age; Fragmented. McPherson uses the historical timeframe of 3D illusions to label an entire study as being racist. Aside from being a far reach into making an argument, the entire basis of this point is illogical and -when reading and trying to decipher its meaning within the essay- comes across as a weak foundation to rationalize the entirety of the essay to follow. Not only is assuming that a study and organization of digital media is racist improbable, but to base an entire argument on the development of 3D illusions and the culture around them is ridiculous. To assume that lenticular lenses and stereoscopes are a definition of a time frame's ideologies and practices is to label an entire generation of people based off a near-useless device. Stereoscopes were made to create a 3D image that people can view for a pleasurable experience. Lenticular postcards and bookmarks were made to offer a similar experience and more, without the need of a device to see it. Neither were implications of the time nor how humanities have grown. If anything, it’s a statement to how technology has improved.

McPherson then moves onto UNIX, a base operating system that inspired LINUX and Mac OSX, and influenced Windows. Much of the paper’s argument lies within this section based around one piece of technology, however, as Kirschenbaum states that DH is “more akin to a common methodological outlook than an investment in any one specific set of texts or even technologies.” Instead of looking at a system as whole, McPherson looks at one particular aspect of the UNIX os. McPherson outlines the rules of coding and programming within the UNIX system, but focuses only on the Rule of Modularity. She spends much of this section explaining how UNIX and other similar operating systems work when trying to work efficiently and effectively; remove and separate unneeded or troublesome pieces.

<sub>Voyant word cloud for McPherson's article: 'UNIX' and 'modularity' are two of the top four most used words at 74 and 40 uses respectively.</sub>

 The next piece of text is where McPherson begins to compare apples to oranges; she explains how the modularity and thinking system of UNIX reflects that of the first half of the twentieth century. McPherson claims that the ‘proper’ working parts of the system equate the the ‘Whites Only’ ideals and the troublesome parts are the racial end of the system, as if it were lynching and isolating them. McPherson’s claim here is that a computer system, meant to run efficiently and effectively without user input, is built racist due to similarities and development during pre-civil rights times. This avoids one crucial piece of logic, however; computers and people are not one in the same. One is created by the other, yes, but if a computer were to allow troublesome code and frameworks within its system, the computer fails to continue to work properly, efficiently or effectively. McPherson appears to ignore the fact that the rule set for UNIX was not listed as it was because of racist ideology, but rather to keep a computerized system running smoothly and effectively. If you leave a virus on a computer, it will cause issues for the user. If a file is corrupted in a program, it needs to be removed and replaced to continue working. Much like McPherson’s previous point with the 3D toys, her argument here falls into the same farfetched reach at something that just isn’t there.

McPherson’s argument is one that makes you scratch your head and ask what you just read. She brings forward something that could cause issues: racism within the digital humanities, but how she approaches and presents her argument brings no ground to the debate, thus her point never gains any reason to be agreed to. If DH are ‘So White’ then it wouldn’t be in the foundation of a computer operating system or the manufacturing of a 3D illusion. It would be within the physical forms of digital humanities, where people interact and develop new forms of digital media. Racism is not part of a computer’s coding, a virus is not a metaphor for a person of colour, removing it is not similar to lynching and quarantining it is not the same as being “isolated in ‘deteriorating city centers.’” The arguments are far and wide from an actual, strong point. I don’t disagree with McPherson that there could potentially be a form of racism within digital humanities. I do, however, disagree with this article and her points within it.
