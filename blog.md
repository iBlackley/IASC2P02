# McPherson's Radical Ideology
Tara McPherson argues within her essay titled
‘Why are the Digital Humanities so White?/ Thinking the Histories of Race and Computation’ that the study, practices and development 
of Digital Humanities (DH), is, in its core, an unintentionally racist field of study. She argues that due to the time frame and people
working within DH during its origination (post-WWII computational culture) that the very programming and foundation of the study is grown
from and engaged upon without consideration of race. I argue that everything McPherson displays and illustrates about DH being racist is
not logical as she compares a system of coding and operating in a computer to that of the real world. Furthermore, McPherson stretches
analogies and comparisons thin to form a confirmation-bias. From UNIX to lenticular lenses, McPherson’s essay takes unorganized turns
to try to deceit the reader into agreeing with her.

First I’d like to outline the illogical ideas that McPherson presents, mainly focusing on her prospect of the lenticular lens. McPherson
brings up the idea of a lenticular lense, the ones used for 3D postcards and bookmarks that a kid would enjoy. She compares it to the 
stereoscope, a similar 3D image illusion made during the industrial era and around the time of civil rights movement. She argues that
since the stereoscope  creates one whole image, and not multiple fragmented ones like the lenticular lens, that it reflects the cultures 
of their respective time frames. Industrial and civil rights; Whole. Digital computer age; Fragmented. McPherson uses the historical
timeframe of 3D illusions to label an entire study as being racist. Aside from being a far reach into making an argument, the entire
prospect of this point is illogical and when reading and trying to decipher its meaning within the essay comes across as a weak intro 
and basis to rationalize the entirety of the essay to follow. Not only is assuming that a study and organization of digital media is 
racist improbable, but to base an entire argument on the development of 3D illusions and the culture around them is ridiculous. To assume
that lenticular lenses and stereoscopes are a definition of a time frames ideologies and practices is to label an entire generation of 
people based off a near-useless device. Stereoscopes were made to create a 3D image that people can view for a pleasurable experience.
Lenticular postcards and bookmarks were made to offer a similar experience and more, without the need of a device to see it. Neither were
implications of the time nor how humanities have grown. If anything, it’s a statement to how technology has improved.

McPherson then moves onto UNIX, a base operating system that inspired LINUX and Mac OSX, and influenced Windows. Much of the paper’s
argument lies within this section based around one piece of technology, however, as Kirschenbaum states that DH is “more akin to a common
methodological outlook than an investment in any one specific set of texts or even technologies.” Instead of looking at a system as whole,
McPherson looks at one particular aspect of the UNIX os. McPherson outlines the rules of coding and programming within the UNIX system,
but focuses only on the Rule of Modularity. McPherson spends much of this section explaining how UNIX and other similar operating systems
work when trying to work efficiently and effectively; remove and separate unneeded or troublesome pieces.
