## About Me

My name is Roger Ian Blackley and I am a student in the Interactive Arts and Sciences program at Brock University, looking to learn about animation and design in order to persue a career in either Game development or film and TV. Outside of animation, I have interests in music and story writing, which I am actively looking to become more involved with both. I am currrently enrolled in ym second year of IASC at Brock University. I am focusing on Digital Expression, mainly dealing with animaiton and world creation with interests in video game development. I am currently working on personal projects to better learn and gain experience with model creation and character animating. I hope to take skills I leanred and will learn into creating video games or creating CGI characters in moives and television shows.

The Project goes over the hsitory of long-forgotten relics of personal nevigation before the GPS was even imagined. Through The Plus Four Wristlet, Iter Avto, and the Jones Live Disc, the project shows and explains the pros and cons of these devices. The project also compares each one to modern day versions that may have been inspired by, if not directly, to these relics. Going back as far as 1893, the project overlooks each way people tried to make navigating even festivals easier.
